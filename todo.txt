To do list:
----------
- Determine how to tell weapon type (re: skills)
- /validate [set] - checks all (or specified) set(s) to see if player owns gear and
	is accessible, whether codes are known, whether slot names correct
	(Support ALL
- Check to see if the item you're equipping is accessible. Only an issue when multiple
  options for the slot are available.
- Change ring swap in equipgear to if one found, remove from new set and move position
  for other ring/earring if needed.
- See if way to determine HP for invisible gear
- Check to see if staff swap based on stats out perform based on element
- See if I can tell what debuff is on a bst pet. (If so, code checkinline to use info)
- Determine how much acc/eva needed vs opponent and then load enough gear to address
  what is needed, prioritized by User. Make sure total acc/eva not beyond max possible.
  Start with accuracy.
- Need to be able to search storage slips in validate

Timing Issues
-------------
- Not loading Tabarzin in Sub, recognized sub NIN. (This is a timing issue. When I zoned, it worked fine.)

On Going
--------
- Finish job files for the jobs not coded yet: BLM,RDM,RNG,SAM,NIN

Ongoing questions
-----------------
- How does the client know that it should display "Downloading Data"?
- How can I determine who controls the zone the player is in?
- How can I determine the type of weapon the player is using?

Done
----
- Debuff Reward on BST? -- do /petfood min, reward
- Items: sneak and invis, done for all
- Pet action rework for all
- /lock [slot list|ALL]			-- Locks the specified slots, no param lists locked slots
- /unlock [slot list|ALL]		-- unlocks specified slots
- Precast fixed for all
- /lock and /unlock should accept ears and rings
- Feedback: show slot numbers for locks in display bar
- Feedback: show last loaded gear set in display bar // Shows current action instead | did for SMN and BST
- Sort the lock order. (Numerically sorted now)
- Integrate locks
- Make sure all equipping code uses MoveToCurrent
- Change EquipIt
	/EquipIt Code|Item Name [slot] -- Loads item in specified (or default) slot and locks the slot
	Note: /EquipIt ignores locks, but will set locks
- /equipit doesn't support rings/ears
- /gearset doesn't support rings/ears or //inline conditionals
- Check for correct staff when SMN avatar out, equip if wrong
- Fixed /gearset so that specified table can be parsed
- /unlock/lock support slot #'s
- removed /solo and restricted /tank to (PLD,NIN,RUN,DRK,WAR)
- If already wearing the ring you want to equip, if the slot has changed (i.e., ring2
  to ring1), the slot is left empty. Probably worth emptying the rings and ears if rings
  and/or ears specified before loading set.
- HandleWeaponskill has been moved to gcinclude.lua. Only BST has integrated that code.
- ['Town'] and ['Town_Conditional'] are in both gcinclude.lua and the job lua. (The one
  in gcinclude.lua is the master and the one in the job files let's a player override
  the master for a specific job.)
- Need instrument type default for songs (re: bard)
- Removed check for owning national aketons
- Removed Town/Town_Conditional from gcinclude.lua
- Change toggle "wind" to cycle "instrument". Fixed code to work w/change
- Need element list for songs (re: equipping elemental staves)
- Fixed bug in MoveToCurrent. Single item's level is now checked.
- New: //HP.GE.85HPPV - HP >= 85% Max HP minus accessory boosts (first pass, use maxHP)
- Implemented new ele staff/ele obi/ele gorget finding routines. Removed old ones. It
  addresses the timing issue better than the old way.
- Removed gcinclude.settings.iCurrentLevel. Code directly inquires the player object for
  the synced value. This is more accurate.
- Changed //MP.LT.50 to make sure either the main job or sub job is a caster and then
  checks to see if the MP < 50. Also added the job check to MP.LT.50P.
- New command: /slot. It will lock the specified slot and equip the specified piece
  of gear. Example: /slot neck|6 "Parade Gorget" (the second parameter can either be
  the slot name or the slot number.)
- Added //ACCURACY inline to check if accuracy turned on. Removed accuracy option from
  HandleWeaponskill. (Now the user must use //ACCURACCY in the weaponskill gear definition
  sets.)
  
Not Doing
---------
- /equipit needs //inline support. 
	Very unlikely to be wanted since usually part of a multi-definition line. Skipping
