	The gear sets are self contained, a mixture of direct gear assignments and conditional
	assignments. Each set contains entries identified by the gear slot. If it's a single
	value, it's a direct assignment like: Body = 'Austere Robe', but there can be multiple
	items identified, usually ordered by level: Body = { 'Vermillion Cloak//CARBY','Austere Robe' },
	Any item that has a // appended to it contains an inline conditional. The // code is a test
	to see if the item should be equipped. The level is still checked, but if the inline coded
	test is successful, that piece of gear will be loaded. If you've done a /gc command,
	the item's suitability for the job and accessibility will also be checked.

	Not all sets need to be defined. There is nothing wrong with leaving a set "empty", but don't
	delete any of the sets. All the ones listed here (except for any custom sets) are expected to 
	exist by Luashitacast.
		
	*** Note ***
	/SMN has a problem in that their pet is the level of the subjob, which is not very useful. 
	As a result, /SMN pet actions are treated "as is" without gearset swap support.	As for /DRG,
	please note that the wyvern can't be summoned.

	Also, unlike true pet jobs like SMN and BST, PLD can only have a pet through a subjob. While 
	associated pet gearsets are available, you equally can just skip them since the pet is at 
	half your level.
	
	*** Note 2 ***
	No gear that supports bard songs can be worn by any job except a bard, so there's no explicit
	support given here for /BRD.

		- Moderate changes to artifact armor

	Curing magic addresses healing players/npcs. Each time a cure

	cure potency is capped at 50%. Light's day and/or light weather 
	has a 33% chance to boost the cure's effecacy by 10% each (25%

	meteor skill which is out of era. All elemental spells are consider to be

	nuke spell's tier caps the dINT that is counted, so a tier 1 caps at 100,
	tier 2 at 200, etc. Magic affinity and day/weather can boost/penalize 
	damge. Hitting a single target does more damage (even with an AoE spell)
	than two or more targets. Boosting Magic Attack Bonus (MAB) will increase
