local sets = {
--[[
	The gear sets are self contained, a mixture of direct gear assignments and 
	conditional assignments. Each set contains entries identified by the gear 
	slot. If it's a single value, it's a direct assignment like: Body = 'Austere 
	Robe', but there can be multiple items identified, usually ordered by level: 
	Body = { 'Vermillion Cloak//CARBY','Austere Robe' }, Any item that has a // 
	appended to it contains an inline conditional. The // code is a test to see 
	if the item should be equipped. The level is still checked, but if the inline 
	coded test is successful, that piece of gear will be loaded. If you've done 
	a /gc command, the item's suitability for the job and accessibility will 
	also be checked.
		
	Not all sets need to be defined. There is nothing wrong with leaving a set 
	"empty", but don't delete any of the sets. All the ones listed here (except 
	for any custom sets) are expected to exist by Luashitacast. PLD supports 
	"tanking", so you'll find some sets with an associated "Tank_" set (ex. 
	TP and Tank_TP). Minally include a subset entry in the Tank_ set so that 
	some gear is definied until you create a tanking set.
	Example:
	
	['Tank_TP'] = {
		Subset = 'TP',
	}
		
	*** Note ***
	/SMN has a problem in that their pet is the level of the subjob, which is not very useful. 
	As a result, /SMN pet actions are treated "as is" without gearset swap support.	As for /DRG,
	please note that the wyvern can't be summoned.

	Also, unlike true pet jobs like SMN and BST, PLD can only have a pet through a subjob. While 
	associated pet gearsets are available, you equally can just skip them since the pet is at 
	half your level.
	
	*** Note 2 ***
	No gear that supports bard songs can be worn by any job except a bard, so there's no explicit
	support given here for /BRD.

	
	Horizon changes from retail:
		- Minor changes to artifact armor
		- Significant changes to Ragnarok
		- Holy circle increases damage for party members against undead. Further, it protects
		  from blood aggro (although further testing needed to determine by how much)
		- Chivalry is now available at 45. (It was originally a merit ability.) The recast has
		  also been decreased from 20 to 15 minutes
		- The accuracy of the stun component of "shield bash" has been increased. It now provides
		  an accuracy similar to that of "weapon bash"
		- "Cover" can now be used on alliance members
		- "Shield Mastery" was added. (Originally released in ToAU)
		
		Spells:
			- Banish has been era+'ed to inhibit the target undead monster's TP gain
			- Enlight was added (out of era) and it's level has been decreased from 85 to 40

	* Midcast: Healing Magic *
	**************************
--]]

--[[
	Healing Magic: consisting of all light-based spells, removes 
	some debuffs on players, buffs the caster, cures the health of 
	players or npcs, or causing damage to undead monsters. Healing 
	magic skill affects the	potency of cures while decreasing the 
	likelihood of the caster being interrupted.
	
	Healing spells: cures, curagas, raises, reraises, blindna, cursna,
	paralyna, poisona, silena, stona, and viruna.
--]]
	
--[[	
	Curing magic addresses healing players/npcs. Each time a cure 
	spell is cast, a power calculation is performed to determine 
	the base effect of the spell. After that, any bonuses will be 
	applied. What this means is that MND, VIT and healing magic 
	skill impact your power rating, but once the cap is hit, they 
	have no more influence.
	
		power = (MND*3) + VIT + (Healing Magic Skill*0.6)
	
	This chart lists all RDM curing spells, the power cap, and the 
	effect on HP baseline. The curaga spells are included in case
	you subbed WHM.
	
			Spell		cap		low		high
			-----		---		---		---
			Cure		100		 20		 30
			Cure II		170		 75		 90
			Cure III	300		160		190
			Cure IV		460		330		390
			Curaga		170		 75		 90
			Curaga II	300		160		190
	
	At this point, any bonuses from day's element, weather, elemental
	staff, or gear/food with potency affects will be tacked on. Because
	cure potency is applied after the power cap is determined, it's a
	very attractive parameter to boost up. Just remember though that 
	cure potency is capped at 50%. Light's day and/or light weather 
	has a 33% chance to boost the cure's effecacy by 10% each (25% 
	if double light weather.) Casting cures on darksday or in dark 
	weather has an equal chance of a penalty.
	
	Once the "CuringMagic" set is equipped, the midcast routine will
	also check to see if you have an Apollo/Light staff for it's Cure

	There are two versions of barspells: elemental and status, both of which

	Only one barspell of each type can be enabled at the same time. Pairing 
	barspells that have the same element increases magic evasion further 
	(ex: barparalyze and barblizzard).

	and help resist spell interuptions. It has no effect on damage except for the
	meteor skill which is out of era. All elemental spells are consider to be
	either a nuke or debuff.
	
	Elemental spells: aeros, aerogas, blizzards, blizzagas, burn, burst, drown
	fires, firagas, flare, flood, quake, rasp, sjhock, stones, stonegas, thunders,
	thundagas, tornado, waters, and watergas.

	damage is an extensive process. (If you want to see all of the gory details,
	please refer to the Elemental Magic section in the magic.txt file found in
	the Documentation subdirectory.)
	
	The important things to remember are: the difference between the caster's 
	INT and the monster's INT (dINT) scales the	wider the gap becomes. The 
	nuke spell's tier caps the dINT that is counted, so a tier 1 caps at 100,
	tier 2 at 200, etc. Magic affinity and day/weather can boost/penalize 
	damge. Hitting a single target does more damage (even with an AoE spell)
	than two or more targets. Boosting Magic Attack Bonus (MAB) will increase

	Elemental debuffs work in a simlar fashion to elemental nukes except they

	PLD can use the following weapons: Sword (A+), Club (A-), Staff (A-), Great Sword (B), Dagger (C-), Polearm (E).
	
	Please note that on Horizon you may have access to some weapon skills
