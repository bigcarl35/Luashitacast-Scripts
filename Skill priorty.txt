Gearset prioritization lets the player design what takes priority in the order of steps. There are
three sections where you can designate the order of presidence: fighting (either you or your pet
or both), spell midcast, and weaponskill. Each step is given a letter code and the priority sequence
is just the letters strung together. Listed below for each step is the code and what the step means.
The order displayed here is the default order. It is important to remember that the least important
step goes first and the most important step last. It is also important that at least one of the
gear sets in the sequence be fairly complete so you don't end up with empty slots in your equipment
unnecessarily. There's nothing stopping you from omitting steps, that is up to the player. The
sequence is stored in gcinclude.lua:

				gcinclude.settings.priorityEngaged = 'ABCDEFGH';
				gcinclude.settings.priorityMidCast = 'ABCDEFGH';
				gcinclude.settings.priorityWeaponSkill = 'ABCDE';
				
If you want a different order, just change the sequence order in the job file under the OnLoad
function to the order you want.

Listed below are each type of sequence, their codes, and what they mean. Use this listing to help
you decide if you want to reorder the steps.
