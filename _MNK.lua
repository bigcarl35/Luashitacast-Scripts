	This file contains all the gear sets associated with the MNK job. While it isn't outside of the realm of 
	possibility that the subjob might be able to use gear sets too, that is not the emphasis of this program. 
	It is tailored to handle all the aspects of MNK. If you desire a gear set change to strengthen an ability
	from your subjob that is not supported by this program, you probably will have to make a custom gear set 
	and use the /gearset command to use it.
--]]

local sets = {
--[[
	The gear sets are self contained, a mixture of direct gear assignments and conditional
	assignments. Each set contains entries identified by the gear slot. If it's a single
	value, it's a direct assignment like: Body = 'Austere Robe', but there can be multiple
	items identified, usually ordered by level: Body = { 'Vermillion Cloak//CARBY','Austere Robe' },
	Any item that has a // appended to it contains an inline conditional. The // code is a test
	to see if the item should be equipped. The level is still checked, but if the inline coded
	test is successful, that piece of gear will be loaded. Currently nothing checks to see
	if that item can be equipped by the job it's associated with let alone whether the player
	even has it accessible. Those are all planned for the future. In the mean time the onus is
	on the player to create the correct definitions.
	
	It is recommended that the gear sets not include any gear found in the top line of your 
	equipment grid (main hand, off hand, ranged weapon, ammo). Doing so will mean that TP will be 
	reset to 0 whenever gear is changed which can be very frustrating. Further, any time you do 
	change a weapon, it will convert back to what was defined in a set.	Believe me, it's no fun	
	fighting Luashitacast!

	Also, not all sets need to be defined. There is nothing wrong with leaving a set "empty", but don't delete any
	of the sets. All the ones listed here (except for any custom sets) are expected to exist by Luashitacast.
		
	*** Note ***
	Unlike when summoner is used as a subjob, /bst's pets are charmed at the max level of your BST or the level
	of your MNK, whichever is lower. That means you can charm higher level mobs than you would expect with /bst.
	Just note though that you can't have two pets, so if you have charmed a pet with /bst, you can't summon your
	avatar and visa versa.
	
	*** Note 2 ***
	No gear that supports bard songs can be worn by any job except a bard, no there's no support given here for
	/BRD.
