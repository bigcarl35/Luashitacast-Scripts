- The dynamic gear table can now only be populated through the /gc command. The
  piecemeal approach that was first implemented has been removed. This means that
  if /gc is not run, no gear swapping will take place.
  
- /gc now takes about 2 seconds to run (1/2 a second longer than before.) This is
  because it is more thorough and tracks more information, including if gear is
  stored on the Porter Moogle.
  
- Added a couple of counters to /showit. For each slot it shows the number of
  owned and accessible gear/number of registered gear.
  
- /gc now checks that the gear is being targetted for the correct slot.
