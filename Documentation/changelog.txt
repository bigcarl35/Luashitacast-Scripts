- Added /SS (exclusive to THF.) When enabled, if the THF steals, a message will indicate they
  did so, identifying the target and it's associated ID. If off, the steal happens without
  a message.

- Added /PULL. This will "pull" the target with a ranged attack or with a pet if you're a SMN,
  BST, or PUP. A message identifying the name of the target and it's identifying ID is relayed
  to the party. Added /SPF so that the message display can be turned on or off.

- Fixed problem with /SMG displaying a set which contained a subset of multiple sets. It can
  now handle one depth down. The following example now displays correctly:

    ['Resting_Regen'] = {
		Subset = {
			[1] = {
				'Damage_Taken_Breath//DT_BREATH',
				'Damage_Taken_Magical//DT_MAGICAL',
				'Damage_Taken_Physical//DT_PHYSICAL',
			}
		},
        Waist = 'Hierarch Belt',		-- +2 HP/tick while resting
    },

  Alternatively you might be inclined to change that set to:

		Subset = {
			[1] = 'Damage_Taken_Breath//DT_BREATH',
			[2] = 'Damage_Taken_Magical//DT_MAGICAL',
			[3] = 'Damage_Taken_Physical//DT_PHYSICAL',
			}
		},
        Waist = 'Hierarch Belt',		-- +2 HP/tick while resting
    },

  Because the three damage taken sets are mutually exclusive, this would have the same result,
  although the processing is less efficient.

- Changed Gate of Tartarus from an Ice to Dark elemental skill.

- Changed slots affected on Mandragora Suit to Body, Hands, Legs, and Feet. Change needed due
  to recent patch.

- Changed Midcast on THF to see if target is a monster and TH enabled, it will now equip
  TH gear.

- Fixed an error in /gc if the character has no storage slips. It now prints "none".

- Fixed small logic confusion when checking for national aketons, Ducal Aketon was uneffected.

- Fixed error in routine that checked for an enchantment buff.

= Added //ME inline. It checks to see if the target is the player.
