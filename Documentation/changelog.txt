- Added check for ['Ref'] being null in fCheckForElementalGearByValue. Added 
  check for ['visible'] being null in fValidateSpecial.

- When checking for a multislot item, all affected slots are checked to make 
  sure they are not locked. This is true for both normal gear swapping and
  for /equipit.

- EquipIt now checks the validity of the item to equip, whether you can wear
  it, and is it accessible.
  
- SwapToStave now checks both "Main" and "Sub for locks.
  
- /gc now updates existing records for elemental staves/gorgets/obis if the
  record already exists. Previous behavior was an accidental oversight.
  
- //NOT_WSWAP wasn't working right, now it is.  //IF: was not working correctly,
  it works now.
  
- Detection of storage slips have been added, but searching is not yet available.

- Cleaned up some code, added more information to the gear piece records.
