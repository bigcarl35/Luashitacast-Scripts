- For SMN, changed Blood Pact 'Burning Strike' from Magical to Hybrid 

- Changed /SMG from muli-parameters to val= as in /smg gs=tp or
  /smg slot=hands, changed 'warn' option to 'noac'

- Added //EMPTY, //NOT_TH and //IFNOE inline conditionals

- Added slot referencing in sets (e.g., ['Hands'] = 'Accuracy::Hands')

- /GC reminder is displayed initially at 15 seconds after logging in/
  changing jobs, and then repeatedly at 5 minute intervals
  
- Added processing of Progressive structure to the /GC command

- Replaced fractional accuracy with progressive accuracy. This affects
  accuracy, ranged accuracy and the associated tanking variations
  
- Had to remove collision check between locks and accuracy. Progressive
  accuracy makes it very difficult to track which equipment slots are
  populated
