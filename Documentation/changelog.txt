- Added slot name verification to all gear sets processed in /GC  

- Changed a lot of inline conditionals:
	New - //EMPTY:1, //EMPTY:2, //IF-slot:, //UNLESS, //UNLESS-slot:
		  //ARC_CIRCLE, //HOLY_CIRCLE, //WARD_CIRCLE
	Modified - //EMPTY, //IF
	Removed - //IFNOE, //IFOE, //ABSORBCAST, //BARCAST, //SPIKECAST,
			  //ENCAST, //DARK, //DIVINE, //ENHANCING, //ENFEEBLING,
			  //HEALING, //NINJUTSU, //SINGING, //SUMMONING

- Added Damage_Taken_x sets to job files. These should be used as
  either subsets or via inline references.
  
- Fixed a locking issue when multi-slotted items were equipped in
  a /ei command
  
- Fixed error caused when a subset has multiple conditional subsets
  defined. Erroneously complained about a table...
  
- Fixed syntax in all HandleDefault routines in job files. Minor change
  to syntax for recognizing if no weapon is equipped.
  
- Added //AQUAN and //AMORPH conditions. Have included all appropriate
  monster names up through Wings of the Goddess.

- Added //PETNAME and //NOT_PETNAME conditions. These are tests for
  specific pet names although //NOT_PETNAME will also be true if
  the player has no pet. Added //BP:name to recognize when the
  named blood pact is invoked.

- Created document "Conditional gear by type.txt" which is a reorganization
  of the "Conditional gear master.txt" file. Should be easier to use than
  the "master" version.
