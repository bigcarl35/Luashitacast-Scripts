- Added support for storage slips and claim slips.

- /SMG slot xx and /SMG gs xx now work. Slot lets you display one or
  more slots and gs displays a gear set, in either the job or gcinclude.
  
- /Showit no longer displays all the gear. It displays system variables
  and /gc has been run.

Version 1.5.3a
- Fixed fGetRoot so that the ":" is removed from the root of ninjutsu
  spells.

- "/SMG" and "/SMG warn" work now. The first gives a complete list 
  of the whole dynamic GearDetail table and the latter just those 
  entries that are either invalid or non-accessible.
  
- Changed BLM so that WSWAPping possible. (Forgot about the use of a
  scythe.)
  
- Gathering and crafting sets ignore the weapon swap restriction when
  a gear set is loaded (i.e., it ignores the /WSWAP setting.)
  
- Added storage slips 19 and 22.
