To do list:
----------
- /validate [set] - checks all (or specified) set(s) to see if player owns gear and
	is accessible, whether codes are known, whether slot names correct
	(Support ALL)
- Change ring swap in equipgear to if one found, remove from new set and move position
  for other ring/earring if needed.
- Implement tiered accuracy system. Separate sets for earch tier. Display on job bar
  what (if any tier currently equipped.) Add accuracy tier display in bar
- Need to be able to search storage slips in validate
- Need special routine for Sorcerer's Ring. Part of MAB, active if HPP < 76% and TP < 100%.
- Propogate weapon skill solution in BST job file to other files
 
On Going
--------
- Finish job files for the jobs not coded yet: BLM,RDM

Ongoing questions
-----------------
- How does the client know that it should display "Downloading Data"?
- How can I determine who controls the zone the player is in?

Done
----
- Debuff Reward on BST? -- do /petfood min, reward
- Items: sneak and invis, done for all
- Pet action rework for all
- /lock [slot list|ALL]			-- Locks the specified slots, no param lists locked slots
- /unlock [slot list|ALL]		-- unlocks specified slots
- Precast fixed for all
- /lock and /unlock should accept ears and rings
- Feedback: show slot numbers for locks in display bar
- Feedback: show last loaded gear set in display bar // Shows current action instead | did for SMN and BST
- Sort the lock order. (Numerically sorted now)
- Integrate locks
- Make sure all equipping code uses MoveToCurrent
- Change EquipIt
	/EquipIt Code|Item Name [slot] -- Loads item in specified (or default) slot and locks the slot
	Note: /EquipIt ignores locks, but will set locks
- /equipit doesn't support rings/ears
- /gearset doesn't support rings/ears or //inline conditionals
- Check for correct staff when SMN avatar out, equip if wrong
- Fixed /gearset so that specified table can be parsed
- /unlock/lock support slot #'s
- removed /solo and restricted /tank to (PLD,NIN,RUN,DRK,WAR)
- If already wearing the ring you want to equip, if the slot has changed (i.e., ring2
  to ring1), the slot is left empty. Probably worth emptying the rings and ears if rings
  and/or ears specified before loading set.
- HandleWeaponskill has been moved to gcinclude.lua. Only BST has integrated that code.
- ['Town'] and ['Town_Conditional'] are in both gcinclude.lua and the job lua. (The one
  in gcinclude.lua is the master and the one in the job files let's a player override
  the master for a specific job.)
- Need instrument type default for songs (re: bard)
- Removed check for owning national aketons
- Removed Town/Town_Conditional from gcinclude.lua
- Change toggle "wind" to cycle "instrument". Fixed code to work w/change
- Need element list for songs (re: equipping elemental staves)
- Fixed bug in MoveToCurrent. Single item's level is now checked.
- New: //HP.GE.85HPPV - HP >= 85% Max HP minus accessory boosts (first pass, use maxHP)
- Implemented new ele staff/ele obi/ele gorget finding routines. Removed old ones. It
  addresses the timing issue better than the old way.
- Removed gcinclude.settings.iCurrentLevel. Code directly inquires the player object for
  the synced value. This is more accurate.
- Changed //MP.LT.50 to make sure either the main job or sub job is a caster and then
  checks to see if the MP < 50. Also added the job check to MP.LT.50P.
- New command: /slot. It will lock the specified slot and equip the specified piece
  of gear. Example: /slot neck|6 "Parade Gorget" (the second parameter can either be
  the slot name or the slot number.)
- Added //ACCURACY inline to check if accuracy turned on. Removed accuracy option from
  HandleWeaponskill. (Now the user must use //ACCURACCY in the weaponskill gear definition
  sets.)
- Added conditional to see if the item you're equipping is accessible.
- Came up with method to adjust HP with invisible boosts removed.
- Multiple inline conditionals now supported on an item
- Determine how to tell weapon type (re: skills)
- Need to modify CheckGearIntegrity for when checking codes, accept more than one code
- Need routine for MP check on Uggy Pendant. Only visible gear counted and convert HP 
  to MP on all gear ignored.
- Remove Status from display bar (and associated support code) from gcdisplay.lua
- Dynamic codes: //HP,//HPP,//MP,//MPP,//TP,//TPP.
- Change dynamic inline codes to uniformly support the following operators: .EQ.,.NE.,
  .GT.,.GE.,.LT.,.LE.
- Need special routine for Minstrel's Ring. Has to equipped before song started. HPP < 76%
  and TP < 100%. No special omissions.
  
Not Doing
---------
- /equipit needs //inline support. 
	Very unlikely to be wanted since usually part of a multi-definition line. Skipping
- See if I can tell what debuff is on a bst pet. (If so, code checkinline to use info)
	No way to tell. Instead there's a switch in the gcdisplay that shows what type of
	"Reward" shall be use (equips appropriate chest piece). (Just upgrade either the AF
	or Relic chestpiece to the +1 version and this complication can go away.)
