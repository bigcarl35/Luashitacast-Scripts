To do list:
----------      
- Determine how far a pet is away from a target

- Need list of hybrid weapon skills. 

- recheck smn roles in gcinclude. (ASB code says Burning Strike is hybrid)

- Instead of an automatic progressive accuracy approach, how about adding
  a predefined accuracy path. /acc=P|F will toggle between predefined and 
  fractional.
  
  Predefined:
  - List of gear ordered by priority.
  - /acc +{#}|{max}		Boost to # place, absent assumes bump by 1, or max
  - /nac {-}{#}|{min}	Downgrade to # place, absent assumes down by 1, or min
  
  Fractional:
  - Gear addressed by slot
  - /acc #|slot name{,#|slot,...}	Equip based on slots
  - /nac {#|slot name,...}			Remove by slots
  
- Consider removing /nac, have /acc do everything

Ongoing questions
-----------------
- How does the client know that it should display "Downloading Data"?
- Timing issues are the bane of my existence...
 
Done
----
- Debuff Reward on BST? -- do /petfood min, reward
- Items: sneak and invis, done for all
- Pet action rework for all
- /lock [slot list|ALL]			-- Locks the specified slots, no param lists locked slots
- /unlock [slot list|ALL]		-- unlocks specified slots
- Precast fixed for all
- /lock and /unlock should accept ears and rings
- Feedback: show slot numbers for locks in display bar
- Feedback: show last loaded gear set in display bar // Shows current action instead | did for SMN and BST
- Sort the lock order. (Numerically sorted now)
- Integrate locks
- Make sure all equipping code uses MoveToCurrent
- Change EquipIt
	/EquipIt Code|Item Name [slot] -- Loads item in specified (or default) slot and locks the slot
	Note: /EquipIt ignores locks, but will set locks
- /equipit doesn't support rings/ears
- /gearset doesn't support rings/ears or //inline conditionals
- Check for correct staff when SMN avatar out, equip if wrong
- Fixed /gearset so that specified table can be parsed
- /unlock/lock support slot #'s
- removed /solo and restricted /tank to (PLD,NIN,RUN,DRK,WAR)
- If already wearing the ring you want to equip, if the slot has changed (i.e., ring2
  to ring1), the slot is left empty. Probably worth emptying the rings and ears if rings
  and/or ears specified before loading set.
- HandleWeaponskill has been moved to gcinclude.lua. Only BST has integrated that code.
- ['Town'] and ['Town_Conditional'] are in both gcinclude.lua and the job lua. (The one
  in gcinclude.lua is the master and the one in the job files let's a player override
  the master for a specific job.)
- Need instrument type default for songs (re: bard)
- Removed check for owning national aketons
- Removed Town/Town_Conditional from gcinclude.lua
- Change toggle "wind" to cycle "instrument". Fixed code to work w/change
- Need element list for songs (re: equipping elemental staves)
- Fixed bug in MoveToCurrent. Single item's level is now checked.
- New: //HP.GE.85HPPV - HP >= 85% Max HP minus accessory boosts (first pass, use maxHP)
- Implemented new ele staff/ele obi/ele gorget finding routines. Removed old ones. It
  addresses the timing issue better than the old way.
- Removed gcinclude.settings.iCurrentLevel. Code directly inquires the player object for
  the synced value. This is more accurate.
- Changed //MP.LT.50 to make sure either the main job or sub job is a caster and then
  checks to see if the MP < 50. Also added the job check to MP.LT.50P.
- New command: /slot. It will lock the specified slot and equip the specified piece
  of gear. Example: /slot neck|6 "Parade Gorget" (the second parameter can either be
  the slot name or the slot number.)
- Added //ACCURACY inline to check if accuracy turned on. Removed accuracy option from
  HandleWeaponskill. (Now the user must use //ACCURACCY in the weaponskill gear definition
  sets.)
- Added conditional to see if the item you're equipping is accessible.
- Came up with method to adjust HP with invisible boosts removed.
- Multiple inline conditionals now supported on an item
- Determine how to tell weapon type (re: skills)
- Need to modify CheckGearIntegrity for when checking codes, accept more than one code
- Need routine for MP check on Uggy Pendant. Only visible gear counted and convert HP 
  to MP on all gear ignored.
- Remove Status from display bar (and associated support code) from gcdisplay.lua
- Dynamic codes: //HP,//HPP,//MP,//MPP,//TP,//TPP.
- Change dynamic inline codes to uniformly support the following operators: .EQ.,.NE.,
  .GT.,.GE.,.LT.,.LE.
- Need special routine for Minstrel's Ring. Has to equipped before song started. HPP < 76%
  and TP < 100%. No special omissions.
- Removed Validate. If wanted should be separate lua program.
 - Propogate weapon skill solution in BST job file to other files
- Implement tiered accuracy system. Separate sets for earch tier. Display on job bar
  what (if any tier currently equipped.) Add accuracy tier display in bar
- Locks not displayed when set in a MH
- Need special routine for Sorcerer's Ring. Part of MAB, active if HPP < 76% and TP < 100%.
- Add accuracy sets. Identify by number, it represents specific elements is the
  Accuracy set.
- Determine how to retrieve a player's stat so that the /region can be adapted to test
  if in own territory or not.
- Adjust /HP and /MP to consider if the increase/decrease is true under region 
  control conditions. (No SPECIAL gear has regional conditions.)
- Consider adding inline conditional to check for a piece of gear equipped anywhere.
  Consider searching not only the ccurrent equipment but also the pending equipment.
- Added unregister for packet interception event.
- Midcast, do F after H
- Add INT gear when damage dealing ninjutsu is performed. 
 - Add fractionating a set. This way, instead of using a defaultWeapon, you could say
  you just want the weapons from the ['Start_Weapons']. Look into fractionatedAccuracy
- Add table to check for multi-slot items. If lock one, lock both
- Issue with rings. If /acc rings then nac rings, only ring2 is released. Fixed logic
  error in FractionalAccuracy. Only arose if you had /acc slots enabled and /nac rings
  or ears.
- Pre-check through command (/gearcheck) whether all gear mentioned in job/gcinclude
  is accessible. look-up table for quick checks. Populate as it processes. Try out
  initially on a specific gear set.
- Need to add spell "root" list based on magical affinity. Add the manipulation
  code to gcinclude.lua in the gcinclude.HandleMidcast function, under "H".
- Add inline codes for: Bind, Curse, Doom (includes Bane), Paralysis, Petrify,
  Poison, Silence, Sleep, Weakness, and Shining Ruby.
- The default gear set is the Travel set, no longer the TP set. The exception is
  when the job is tanking. In that case it's the TP_Tank set.
- GSWAP being off should not inhibit the displaybar being updated 
- Lock checking has been removed from fEquipTheGear. Lock checking was added to
  fMoveToCurrent.
- When using /gearswap, change from toggling GSwap to using locks. Only lock the slots 
  loaded by the /gearswap
- Which toolbar is displayed resets to a the default for the job/sj combo when you
  zone. Why?
- Subsets now are supported
- Removed "slot" command. Kind of an unknown command and not that useful
- Rewrote MaxSpell and MaxSong. It now checks not only levels and spell whether the
  player knows the spell, but also does the player have enough MP and is the spell/
  song on cool down.
- For /maxspell or /maxsong, check to see if there's a target specified and use that.
  If none specified, then use <t>. Check spell cd? Might have to back up one
- Need to create a [bar] set for bar- spells. -- Maybe //BARSPELL instead, where that
  recognizes a list of bar-ga spells. --
  //SPELL='list' or variable for spells affected -- use subset
- Can I determine if a spell is on cd? or item on cd? (RecastDelay * 15(?)) If so, use
  in Maxspell.
- Maxspell - possible, indicate two spells (max, -1)
- Need conditional when player fighting but not pet
- Add "San" ninjutsu to tiered spell list, offensive spells only
- Renamed DefaultTarget to DefaultSpellTarget and named default target for song to 
  DefaultSongTarget
- Added bard song affinities 
- Change to not use elemental staff when summoning an avatar, but rather swap
  weapons once the pet is out.
- Add //PETNF
- Modified ShowIt to remove variables that were dropped and added display of the dynamic
  gear list
- Add /gc reminder to SetVariables function
- /ei w/o parameters lists all codes and the item it equips
- Add day, time, moon phase, weather, --zone (location) to display bar
- Consider splitting out ranged WS from the melee WS. ex: WS_RANGED_AGI for Hot Shot, etc
- Y's scythe +1 dark affinity. This is a specialty case specifically for DRK. If
  WSWAP is enabled, Y's Scythe equipped, casting a dark spell, and the player has
  a dark staff, but not a pluto staff, the dark staff should not be equipped. Losing
  the tp would be wasted.
- Add inline conditional for root spell recognition. EX: gear//SPELL:POISON
- Check that zone id's correct. There's a descrepancy in the master list...
- Change Midcast section. Instead of what we're currently doing, have it broken out by
  the type of spell (i.e., a section for each type: [Healing], ['elemental'], etc.)
  Each section has it's own set and you use inline codes for the variations:

  ['Enhancing'] = {
 	  Body = 'Blessed Bliaut//BARSPELL',
  },

  So, Magic Attack Bonus would be applied with all magic attack spells including hybrid
  weapon skills. I.e., apply MAB to elemental offence spells, dots like dia and bio
  that have an initial attack damage, etc.

  Individual spells of the "type" would be included in each section
  Common routines included with each type: obi and elemental stave  
 - add AttackPower subset, remove Tank_WS_*, fix comments
 - Removed the following inline conditionals (obsolete): //ACCURACY, //CURE, //SPELL:,
   //IFC:
 - Added the following inline conditionals: //EN"spell", //ENANY, //LVL"condition"
 - Changed //SO: to //SP:. Now handles both songs and spells. 
 - When SA or TA is used, the DEX gear stays equipped when player is engaged until they
   hit a target or the buff wears out.
 - Certain items grant an "enchantment" buff when used. When enabled, the item will 
   remain equipped until the buff wears out or the item is physically unequipped.
 - Idle has been added to the display bar for all jobs. When enabled, Default gear will
   be equipped when the player is idling. (This use to be a tank-only option.) Idle
   behavior has been removed from /TANK.
 - Added inline conditional //NOT_UTSUSEMI
 - Added legend bar showing zone name below minimap. Also, moving either the
   display bar or the zone bar, the position will be remembered between sessions.
 
Possibly in the future
---------------------- 
 - Add Event to display bar. Values: none, assault, besieged, campaign, garrison, salvage,
  Fellow
  
- Need to be able to search storage slips

- Add an inline conditional to a slot name. It implies that all gear in that slot's
  definition has that conditional applied to it. Example:
  
	Main//WSWAP = { list of weapons }
	
	or
	
	Neck//NIGHTTIME = { ...}
	Neck//DAYTIME = { ... }
	
	or
	
	Head = { ... }
	Head//TANK = { ... }
	
  The second example introduces the idea off having multiple lines addressing the
  same slot. Which is process depends on the inline conditional. The third example
  might be a way to combine TP and TP_Tank. Still not convinced implementing this
  feature would be worth the effort.
  
	I think this one is doable!

- Make it so you can pull a line from another set. 
		Ex: head = { 'Lilac Corsage//TOWN','TP:head' },
  for load the corsage if in town, else process TP's head line

- modify equipit to check to see if the item is on cool down and to keep searching
  for another one to equip. I know how to get the general information about an item 
  (name, description, etc), but not how many charges are left or what is the cool 
  down on the item. I'm guessing this is sent in a packet, maybe upon zoning. A 
  comparison to a master clock? More investigation is needed.

- Double Midcast -- Looking at the sample code that obijam linked, this is not
	generalized. This would be specific for a spell. You need to know a priori
	the fast cast value, the casting gear reduction, the packet delay, the cast
	delay to determine if there's enough time for an addition midcast call.
	
  Not Doing
---------
- /equipit needs //inline support. 
	Very unlikely to be wanted since usually part of a multi-definition line. Skipping
	
- See if I can tell what debuff is on a bst pet. (If so, code checkinline to use info)
	No way to tell. Instead there's a switch in the gcdisplay that shows what type of
	"Reward" shall be use (equips appropriate chest piece). (Just upgrade either the AF
	or Relic chestpiece to the +1 version and this complication can go away.)
	
- /validate [set] - checks all (or specified) set(s) to see if player owns gear and
	is accessible, whether codes are known, whether slot names correct
	(Support ALL). [Validate has been removed from luashitacast. At some point I'll
	probably make it into a stand-alone addon.]
	
- Need to be able to search storage slips in validate. (Look to the Find addon code.)
	Not doing since I only look in areas where accessible outside of moghouse and the
	porter slips are not accessible unless talking to a porter moogle with your slip.
	
- Change ring swap in equipgear to if one found, remove from new set and move position
  for other ring/earring if needed. (This shouldn't be necessary.)
  
- Add way to check that multiple of same ring or earring is valid
	There's no way to determine if repeated items are because of a couple of inline
	conditionals vs two of the same item. Example:
		rings = { x//POISONED,x//PETRIFIED }
	Does that mean you have two of ring "x" that are qualified or only one where you
	want to match one of the two conditionals?
	
- Need to support a gear type: *OBI, *STAFF, *GORGET. In each case, what piece
  of gear will be equipped is dynamically determined.
  
		Waist = '*OBI',

	The elemental aspects will be dealt with in context. While the idea of processing
	in situ is appealing, it gets really hard to figure out "why" the player wants
	an elemental piece of gear. The why tends to be the driving factor. So instead of
	listing a generic elemental reference, the code will call to equip an elemental
	piece of gear by the context of the calling routine.
	
- Look for "Enchantment:" qualifier on HP/MP boosts... no, look for conditional qualifiers.
  You might find a day (ex. Darksday: MP-15%) or some other qualifier. The table will not
  support the qualifier, that has to be done w/an inline conditional. Maybe just carry
  the "values" as qualified?
  
  First pass: assume that if the item has been equipped, the "conditional" whatever it is
  has been met. I'm not sure I'll go beyond this first pass, although maybe I'll support
  conditionals that currently are supported in the second pass. We'll see.
  
  Gear that has hidden effects will not be supported since the details are not in the
  description.	(I'm just assuming that the conditions for the enchantment/activity
  were met.)
  
- Need to add ninjutsu affinities. Ninjutsu does not use elemental affinity, so
  equipping and elemental staff will have no effect
  
- Problem on DRK, reference to "invisible" not defined. Think some special circumstances
  arose with the Uggy Pendant //SPECIAL check. Try to keep an eye open for that happening
  again. Unable to repeat.
  
  Update: have repeated. Think it's an issue of the item not being correctly instantiated.
  Reloading Luashitacast fixed the problem. I'm guessing that /GC would also resolve the
  issue. (Oh, in this case, it was me equipping a Balmung that caused the problem.)
  
  Update 2: pretty sure /gc fixes this problem
  
  Fix: //SPECIAL will always return false until /gc run.
  
- When I added a pluto's staff and reran /gc, it did not recognize the pluto's staff.
  But when I reloaded luashitacast, it did recognize it and since I've changed jobs,
  it always recognizes it. 
  
  Only happened once. Unless it can be demonstrated again, it'll just remain an oddity.
