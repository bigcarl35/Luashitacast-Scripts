- Added a lot of new inline conditionals including inverted conditionals. (See "Conditional gear by
  type.txt" for a complete list). (3)

- Added support for inline conditionals on slot names. (4)

- Added grouping and changed subset priority to be dependent on depth. (Subsets in groups will be
  processed when the group is processed and not when the gear set is being processed.) (20)

- All tank sets have been removed. Instead, any gearset can have groups defined for TANK and NON_TANK
  in them. (2)

- Removed code that dynamically generates gear listings as sets are being loaded. This feature is
  no longer being supported since /gc is now required and it creates all of the entries then. (A1)

- Changed how BST's AJug's favorability works. tJugPets moved from Job file to gear.lua. Introduced
  FavoredJugs into BST job file, a simple list ordering what is favored. This is read in and updated
  via GearCheck.

- Changed how MPP and HPP are gotten from the GetPlayer() function. Percentages are now more accurate.
  (17)

- Changed the display bar labels for Accuracy. Acc used for Acc and TAcc, RAcc for RAcc and TRAcc. (B22)

- Added support for groups to inline reference translation. Subsets are still ignored.

- Fixed issue where code for a buff has a "_" in them thus not matching buff name.

- Changed priority for Kite. It now ignores locks and any items that have to be kept on. Kiting
  takes priority. (Aside, you could argue that a high breath mantle or breath mantle buff should
  remain intact. Need to consider this.)

- You can now indicate whether Refresh or Regen has priority when you rest.

- HandleAbility, HandlePetAction, HandleItem, HandlePrecast, HandleMidcast, Handle Preshot, HandleMidshot,
  and HandleWeaponskill are now stub functions in the job files (unless there's job specific functionality
  needed) and now the in common aspects are in crossjobs by similarly named functions. (A4,A5,A6)

- Added support to all pet actions regardless if the pet is from a main or sub job. (A13)

- Custom weaponskill gear sets are now supported. (15)

- Subsets don't require order numbers now if only one subset is specified. Further, subsets can be a
  single string, an unindexed table, and an indexed table. All three types are supported. (19)

- Added command /val for validating gear sets. This command checks item validity, inline conditionals
  validity, code usage validity, subsets to ensure they include existing sets, and inline references are
  checked for valid gear set references. (21)

- All toggle/cycle manipulation is now done in the utilities module (A7)

- All action routines in the job files now call shared action routines in the crossjobs module. (A9)

- The display bar has been modified to show the actions in the same order regardless of job. (Job
  specific actions can be interspersed in the bar.)

- Added configurable option to job files so that player can indicate if they want LUASHITACAST to
  equip the job appropriate macro book and macro page.
