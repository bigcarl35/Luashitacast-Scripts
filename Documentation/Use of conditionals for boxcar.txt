In the past, where you could use what inline conditional wasn't complicated. For the most part, all inline
conditionals were pretty much used the same way: on the right side after a piece of gear, but with the
changes being introduced in BOXCAR, that is not necessarily the case. New flexibility has been added that
lets you put inline conditionals on slots as well as gear and some inline conditionals are for specific
types of entries. This documemt lists all of the inline conditionals, where they can be placed, and includes
any notes that are special in nature.

First, let's diagram position through an example. The left side tends to identify the slots, and the right
side the prioritized list of gear. Inline conditionals can be on the left side slots, the right side gear
pieces, or on either side. Further, some conditionals are specific to subsets. Listed below are two gear
sets representing a normal TP set and a tanking TP set for thief (THF). These are formatted according to
the current version (KARMA) of luashitacast. Below that is a new version according to what BOXCAR will
enable you to do.

Current version (Karma):

    ['TP'] = {
        Subset = {
            [1] = 'Default'
        },
        Head  = { 'Homam Zucchetto', 'Rogue\'s Bonnet', 'Empress Hairpin' },
        Hands = { 'Homam Manopolas', 'Dusk Gloves' },
        Waist = { 'Swift Belt', 'Mrc.Cpt. Belt' },
    },

    ['Tank_TP'] = {
        Subset = {
            [1] = 'Tank_Default'
        },
        Head  = { 'Asn. Bonnet +1', 'Assassin\'s Bonnet', 'Homam Zucchetto' },
        Neck  = 'Peacock Amulet',
        Ears  = { 'Ethereal Earring', 'Stealth Earring//SJNIN', 'Brutal Earring' },
        Body  = { 'Dragon Harness//DT_BREATH', 'Narasimha\'s Vest', 'Assassin\'s Vest', 'Scorpion Harness', 'Brigandine', 'Wonder Kaftan' },
        Hands = { 'Homam Manopolas', 'Assassin\'s Armlets' },
        Rings = { 'Kshama Ring No.4', 'Bomb Queen Ring', 'Kshama Ring No.3' }
    },

New version (Boxcar):

    ['TP'] = {
        Subset = { 'Default//NOT_TANK','Tank_Default//TANK' },
        Group//NOT_TANK = {
            Head  = { 'Homam Zucchetto', 'Rogue\'s Bonnet', 'Empress Hairpin' },
            Hands = Hands = { 'Homam Manopolas', 'Dusk Gloves' },
            Waist = { 'Swift Belt', 'Mrc.Cpt. Belt' },
        },
        Group//TANK = {
            Head  = { 'Asn. Bonnet +1', 'Assassin\'s Bonnet', 'Homam Zucchetto' },
            Neck  = 'Peacock Amulet',
            Ears  = { 'Ethereal Earring', 'Stealth Earring//SJNIN', 'Brutal Earring' },
            Body  = { 'Dragon Harness//DT_BREATH', 'Narasimha\'s Vest', 'Assassin\'s Vest', 'Scorpion Harness', 'Brigandine', 'Wonder Kaftan' },
            Hands = { 'Homam Manopolas', 'Assassin\'s Armlets' },
            Rings = { 'Kshama Ring No.4', 'Bomb Queen Ring', 'Kshama Ring No.3' }
        }
    },

Another thing to note is that most inline conditionals check for an existing condition: is TANKing enable, does
the player have a specific buff/debuff, is it a specific time of day, etc. But some conditionals refer to an
ongoing action. This would be things like //SPELL:BAR to see if a barspell is being cast or //SONG:ETUDE to
see if one of a bard's etude songs is being cast. It's important to recognize context.

With Boxcar, it's important to recognize that there sides. Some conditionals only work on the right side, the
gear/subset definition while others work on both sides: slots and definitions. Others still work on both sides
but omit specific circumstances like not on subsets or groups. See the list below for inline conditionals that
are restricted in some way.

Conditional         Side    Notes
---------------------------------
//[NOT_]SLOTS:list  Both    Can only be used on a subset
//IF:               Both    Can't be attached to a subset or group
//IF-slot:          Both
//SPECIAL           Right   This is bound to a specific piece of gear
//TRACK:#           Right   This is bound to a specific piece of gear
