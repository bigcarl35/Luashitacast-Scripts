- Change all references of SummonStaves:
	gcinclude.SummonStaves[pet.Name]
  To:
    gcinclude.SummonStaves[string.lower(pet.Name)]

- Exchange //ELEAVA for //SPIRIT:ES	-- duplicate inline conditional, removed //ELEAVA

- Remove from HandleDefault:
	gcdisplay.SetLocksAction(gcinclude.LocksNumeric,player.Status);

- In Bard job file, add ['Song_Midcast_Buff'] set below 'Song_Midcast' set.
  In HandleMidcast function, add the following after:

	profile.HandleSongMidcast();

	gcinclude.MoveToCurrent(sets.Song_Midcast_Buff,sets.CurrentGear);
- In PLD/DRK job file, in OnLoad function, remove:
  	-- Special inits for "checking HP" gear
	gcinclude.Special['Parade Gorget'][72] = { 0, 0, 10, 10 };		-- HP on invisible gear: TP, Tank_TP, Acc, Tank_TP + Acc
  
- In  HandleDefault, Change:
			elseif cKey == 'E' then		-- Accuracy		
				if gcdisplay.GetToggle('Acc') == true then 
					if bTank == true then
						gcinclude.MoveToCurrent(sets.Tank_Accuracy,sets.CurrentGear);
					else
						gcinclude.MoveToCurrent(sets.Accuracy,sets.CurrentGear);
					end
				end
	To:
		elseif cKey == 'E' then		-- Accuracy	
			gcinclude.FractionalAccuracy(sets.Accuracy,sets.Tank_Accuracy);

- Add:
	-- Accuracy Sets are predefined /acc commands. You identify them by a name and
	-- a comma delimited list of slots. It's just a convenient shortcut mechanism.
	profile.AccuracySet = {
		['base'] = 'Rings,Body',		-- This is an example
	};
	
- Add:
	-- RegionControlGear identifies a piece of gear that can be used to automatically
	-- determine if the player is currently in a zone controlled by their nation or
	-- not. The definition includes the name of the piece of gear, whether HP or MP 
	-- is affected, and whether the piece requires region ownership or not the region 
	-- ownership.
	profile.RegionControlGear = { 'Republican Gold Medal','MP',false };
