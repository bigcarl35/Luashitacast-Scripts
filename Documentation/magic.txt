Healing Magic
	- The higher the Healing Magic skill, the less likely that a healing magic spell
      will be interrupted.
	- All healing magic are light-based spells
	- Healing spell: cures, curagas, raises, reraises, blindna, cursna, paralyna,
	  poisona, silena, stona, and viruna.
	  
	Curing Magic (Cure and Curaga)
		- All curing magic on Horizon have potency caps based on the form of the spell
		  and the "power" calculation which is defined as follows:
		  
		  power = (MND*3) + VIT + (Healing Magic Skill*0.6)
		  
		  Spell			  low cap	low effect	  high effect
		  -----------------------------------------------------
		  Cure		  		100			20				 30   
		  Cure II	  		170			75				 90
		  Cure III    		300		   160			    190
		  Cure IV     		460		   330			    390
		  Cure V      		560		   570			    690
		  Curaga	  		170			75			  	 90
		  Curaga II	  		300		   160			    190
		  Curaga III  		460		   330			    390
		  Curaga IV   		560		   570			    690
		  
		  Pollen	  		100			24				 34
		  Healing Breeze	460		   120				180
		  Magic Fruit		300		   370				490
		  Exuviation		100		 	70		 		 80
		  
		  - Numbers taken from the AirSkyBoat code
		  
		  What that means is that if the player's power is below the low cap,
		  the cure's base heal will be the low effect. As soon as the power is 
		  >= the low cap, cure's base heal will be the high effect. Any bonuses
		  from day, weather, staff, and potency are then tacked on.
		  
		  That means that boosting your power rating by upping your MND, VIT or
		  Healing Magic Skill only has so much effect, depending on the spell level
		  and power caps.
		  
		  Light's day (matches healing magic element) and Light's weather (or 
		  double weather) have a chance to add 10% and 10%/25% respectively. 
		  There's approximately a 33% chance for these bonuses to proc. (Please 
		  note that the Dark's day/weather will penalize following the same 
		  ratios and dark weather values.) If using a Korin obi, the day/weather
		  bonuses are guaranteed to happen.
		  
		  Cure potency ignores the power cap making it a very attractive trait 
		  to boost up, but it is capped at 50%. Please note that cure potency
		  does not affect the damage on undead, it is ignored.
		  
		  As to Light/Apollo staff, you get a 10% bonus cure potency. The magic
		  affinity from the staff only applies to damaging spells, so in this
		  case, when you're casting a cure on an undead target.
	- Bottom line, on Horizon, healing magic is only gear dependent on cures
	
Enhancing Magic
	- Enhancing Magic skill determines the potency and spell interruption rate of
	  enhancing magic spells, although for some of the spells, potency has no effect.
	- Barspells: 
		- Only one elemental bar spell and one status bar spell can be applied at
		  the same time.
		- Single target bar spells are stronger than AoE bar spells. The single
		  target bars spell will overwrite the AoE spell regardless of the level.
		- Resistence gained from barspells = (Enhancing Magic Skill/5) + 40,
		  rounded down. 
		- Duration starts at 2 minutes 30 seconds and increases by .8 seconds per 
		  enhancing magic skill point over 180, until a maximum of 4 minutes is 
		  attained.
	- Stoneskin:
		- Prevents a certain amount of damage
		- The amount of damage absorbed by stoneskin is calculated as follows:
			Base = (Enhancing Magic Skill/3) + MND
			if Base <= 80, then damage absorbed is the base value.
			if 80 <= Base < 130, then damage absorbed is (2*Base) - 60.
			if 130 <= Base, then damage absorved is (3 * Base) - 190.
			Stoneskin caps at 350.
			Gear that "enhances" stoneskin adds a 30 bonus (sub 75 gear).
	- Phalanx:
		- Gives the player a certain amount of damage resistance
		- The amount of damage resistance of phalanx is calculated as follows:
			if enhancing magic skill <= 300, (Enhancing Magic Skill/10) - 2
			if enhancing magic skill > 300, (Enhancing Magic Skill - 300.5)/28.5 + 28
			Damage reduction caps at 35 (500 Enhancing Magic Skill)
	- Sneak and Invisible:
		- Only adjustment available is gear that lengthens the duration.
		- Duration minimum is random, but duration is capped at 5 mins. (Not sure the
		  cap is true, I think I've seen 6 mins when wearing dream +1 gear.)
	- Magic affinity does not affect Enhancing Magic
	- Enhancing spells: bar/ra elemental spells, bar/ra status spells, aquaveil, 
	  blink, stoneskin, phalanx, protect/ra spells, shell/ra spells, erase, regen, 
	  refresh, deoderize, invisible, sneak, haste, spike spells (not dread),
	  escape, teleport spells, warp spells, en- spells (except enlight, that's
	  Divine Magic)
	- Bottom line, enhancing magic has some exceeptions. Need special handling for
	  barspells, and then break outs for certain spells.
	  
Elemental Magic
	- Elemental Magic encompasses spells that fall into several subcategories:
		- Elemental Nukes - spells that cause elemental damage to one or more targets
		- Ancient Magic - Long cast time spells with a resistance dampening effect of
		  the element it is weak to. (For example, Freeze lowers resistance to Fire
		  spells.)
		- Cumulative Magic - (out of era) - hits of the same element after application
		  increase the damage output. Tend to have a -ja suffix
		- Helix - (out of era) - spells that cause initial damage as well as high DoT
		- Meteor - (out of era) - spell not associated with the eight elements, but
		  is considered elemental. This is does not include Carbuncle's Meteor.
		- Elemental Debuffs - Spells which reduce a single enemy attribute and 
		  cause a minimal DoT
	- Elemental Magic Skill determines the accuracy and spell interruption rate of all
	  elemental magic spells. It does not affect the damage of elemental magic spells
	  except for "meteor".
	- Magic Damage is calculated from the following formula:
		Damage = D x MTDR x Staff x Affinity x Resist x Resistance Rank Reduction x
			MB x MBB x Day & Weather x MAB/MDB x TMDA x Potency Multipliers
		- D: INT-adjusted base spell damage
		- MTDR: Multiple Target Damage Reduction (for AoE's)
		- Staff: Elemental Staff hidden damage bonus multiplier
		- Affinity: Elemental affinity bonus multiplier (from staves and Magic Atk. Bonus)
		- Resist: Reduction of spell damage due to resist states
		- Resistance Rank Reduction: Reduction of spell damage due to resistance rank
		- MB: Magic Burst
		- MBB: Magic Burst Bonus
		- Day & Weather: Day and weather multipliers including iridescence and preismatic
		- MAB/MDB: Caster Magic Attack Bonus divided by target's Magic Defense Bonus
		- TMDA: Target Magic Damage Adjustment (Magic Damage Taken reduction)
		- Potency Multipliers: (possibly all out of era), e.g. Ebullience, Klimaform
		  bonus, Goetia +2 set bonus, etc
		- When calculating magic damage, the product is floored to the next lowest integer
		  before going on to the next multiplier. Each term after "D" starts with a base
		  of 1.0 and increases or decreases by caster and target's stats and attributes
		  as well as other affects
		D = mDMG + V + (dINT x M)
		- V: every damage dealing spell has a base damage value, denoted by V
		- dINT: represents the difference between the caster's INT and the target's INT
		- M: every damage dealing spell has several INT multiplier values denoted as M
		  for different dINT ranges. (For offensive white magic, substitute dMND.)
		- The calculation of D is a piecewise function with the multiplier M changing
		  at the following INT levels:
				dINT = 0 ~ 49, dINT = 50 ~ 99, dINT = 100 ~ 199, dINT = 200 ~ 299,
				dINT = 300 ~ 399, dINT = 400 ~ 499, dINT = 500 ~ 599, dINT > 600
		- When determining D, the appropriate V and M values must be applied depending
		  on the INT difference. Example: dINT = 134, V100 should be chosen for the base
		  damage, and the M which corresponds to dINT = 100 - 199 should be chosen as
		  the multiplier. When choosing the  V value, reduce the dINT by the amount
		  factored into the V value to come up with the correct result (eg, 134 INT
		  when using V100 calculation, use dINT = 134-100 = 34
		- There's charts on: https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Magic_Damage that show the
		  appropriate values for M and Vxx with Vcaps.
		- With dINT < 0, damage will be reduced and potentially zero
		- On tier 1 single target nukes, the damage increase from INT caps at dINT = 100,
		  so more INT on gear will be wasted. Tier 2 caps and 200, 3 at 300, etc.
		MTDR: Multi-Target Damage Reduction
		- For single target spells, MTDR = 1.0
		- For AoE spells with one target, MTDR = 1.0
		- For AoE spells with T targets, 2 <= T <= 10, MTDR = 0.9 - 0.05T
		- For AoE spells with 10 or more targets, MTDR = 0.4
		Staff:
		- For HQ staff with a matching element, staff = 1.15
		- For NQ staff with a matching element, staff = 1.1
		- For NQ staff of opposed element, staff = 0.9
		- For HQ staff of opposed element, staff = 0.85
		- For all other weapons, staff - 1.0
		Affinity, also referred as "Elemental Magic Attack Bonus":
		- (out of era)
		- This is not the affinity you find on elemental staves
		Resist:
		- There are four states of resistance associated with all magical damaging spells:
			- Unresisted: Resist = 1.0
			- 1/2 resisted: Resist = 0.5
			- 3/4 resisted: Resist = 0.25
			- 7/8 resisted: Resist = 0.125
		- Spells with multiple targets, the resist value is calculated for each target
		  independently
		Resistance Rank Reduction:
		- When a monster's resistance rank to an element is 50% or lower, an additional
		  forced resist of 50% is added onto the previous resist, calculated multiplicably.
		Consecutive Elemental Damage Penalty:
		- There's a penalty applied to any elemental magic spell cast on a monster within
		  5 seconds of the same spell being cast on that monster. This is known as a
		  "nuke wall". This causes a -20% spell damage reduction. Casting the same spell
		  again will only do 40~50% damage. This penalty only applies on NMs and excludes
		  elemental damage from skillchains.
		Day & Weather:
		- This starts with a base of 1.0 and additional values add or subtract depending
		  on the day of the week's element, weather, and certain gear (elemental obis.)
		- There's ~33% chance to proc the bonus/penalty due to day or weather.
		- Day:
			Matching day with spell proc: +0.1, opposing day: -0.1, Sorcerer's Tonbon/+1
			and spell proc: +0.05
		- Weather:
			Matching weather and spell proc: +0.1, double weather: +0.25, double weather
			and day: +0.35
			Opposing weather and spell proc: -0.1, opposing double weather: -0.25,
			opposing double weather and day: -0.35. 
			Note that elemental obi of the correct element forces the effect to proc
		Magic Burst:
		- The magic burst multiplier is dependent on the number of weapon skills which
		  resulted in the skill chain formation. This starts at 1.25 for a two stage chain
		  and goes up by 0.1 for each additional stage.
				- No Magic Burst. MB = 1.0
				- 2-stage skillchain. MB = 1.35
				- 3-stage skillchain.  MB = 1.45
				- X-stage skillchain. MB = 1.25 + (0.1 x X)
		Magic Burst Bonus:
			MBB = 1.0 + Gear + [Atma/Atmacite] + [AMII Merits] + Traits
			
			- Gear: any gear with magic burst bonus
			- Atma/Atmacite - (out of era)
			- AMII Merits - (out of era, added ToAU), AMII merits for a specific spell
			  beyond the first one. Level 2 AMII, 0.03. Level 3 AMII, 0.06, Level 4 AMII,
			  0.09, Level 5 AMII, 0.12
			- Trait: See Magic Burst Bonus for trait levels. Varies from 0.05 to 0.13
			  depending on the trait level
		MAB/MDB, Magic Attack Bonus/Magic Defense Bonus:
		- Combines the effects of the caster's MAD with the target's MDB.
			cMAB = 1 + (caster's Magic Attack Bonus / 100)
			tMDB = 1 + (target's Magic Defence Bonus / 100)
			
			MAB/MDB = cMAB/tMDB
		TDMA, Target Magic Damage Adjustment:
		- Certain specific enemies or families of monsters have traits that cause them
		  to take more or less magical damage on a percentage basis. Values are determined
		  as a fraction of 256.
		- The base value for TDMA is 1.0 and is adjusted according to the fractional
		  values for the specific monster type or families and other buffs the target
		  might have. The effects of Shell are included by the Magic Damage Taken term.
		Potency Multipliers: (all out of era)	
	- Elemental bonuses: elemental magic bonuses on equipment fall into three categories:
		- Elemental magic skill bonus: directly adds to player's skill level
		- Elemental casting time reduction: reduces how long it takes to cast a spell, by
			percentage. (Gear out of era)
		- Elemental magic recast time reduction: reduces recast time of elemental spell by
			percentage. (Gear out of era)		
	- Elemental spells: aeros, aerogas, blizzagas, blizzards, burn, burst, drown, firagas,
		fires, flare, flood, quake, rasp, shock, stones, stonegas, thundagas, thunders,
		tornado, waters, and watergas.
	- Bottom line, on Horizon, elemental magic either is a nuke or a status damage DoT
		
Enfeebling Magic
	- Enfeebling magic is a general category of spells which apply a negative status
	  effect (debuff) to one or more targets.
	- Enfeebling Magic Skill determines the accuracy of said spells and the spell
	  interruption rate when cast said spells.
	- All enfeebling spells either completely resist or stick to a target, there's no
	  partials. The duration of a "stuck" spell is highly dependent on the accuracy of
	  the spell relative to the target's resistance (and/or magic evasion).
	- For enfeebling spells with variable potency, the potency is calculated from a
	  formula that varies by spell (blind, slow, paralyze, poison).
	  - Potency = floor(floor(base potency + dStat Modifier) x 
					   (Enfeebling Magic Effect + Gear))
		Duration = (base duration + (6s x RDM group 2 merit level) + RDM Enfeebling Job
			Points) x duration on gear
		Dia duration = (base duration + RDM enfeebling job points + (6s x RDM group 2
			Merit Point level)) x duration listed on gear + duration listed on gear
	- Immunobreak: (out of era)
	- Enfeebling spells: bind, blinds, dias, diaga, dispel, gravity, paralyzes, poisons,
	  poisonga, sleeps, sleepgas, silence, and slows.
	  
Divine Magic
	- Divine magic focuses on damaging or debilitating enemies with light elemental
	  white magic spells. Because of this, divine magic is particularly effective
	  against monsters in the undead family. Banish spells in particular have enhanced
	  properties when used against undead monsters.
	  - Divine "nukes": Spells that cause immediate light elemental damage to one or
	    more targets - banish spells, holy spells
	  - Divine Enfeebling: Spells that are light based variants on black magic enfeebles,
		flash (a high enmity variant of bind) and repose (a variant of sleep, out of era.)
	  - Divine Enhancement: Currently only enlight
	  - Divine Magic Skill determines accuracy and the spell interruption rate on divine
	    magic. It does not affect damage at all.
	  - The damage for "nukes" ic calculated from the magic damage formula (see elemental
	    magic's formula.) The main caster stats that affect damage potential are MND,
		Magic Attack Bonus, and elemental damage affinity and potency bonuses.
	  - Divine spells: banishes, banishgas, enlight, flash, and holy.
	  
Dark Magic
	- Dark magic is a category of darkness elemental black magic which focuses on
	  absorbing from an enemy enhance the caster, including Absorb spells, drain and
	  aspir.
	- Dark magic skill determines accuracy, potency of some spells, and the spell
	  interruption rate of dark magic spells. Dark magic skill does nothing for the
	  potency of absorb spells, but does effect the accuracy and duration.
	- Dark magic bonuses on equipment fall into one of three categories:
		- Dark magic skill bonus: Directly adds to the player's dark magic skill
		- Dark magic casting time reduction: reduces the cast time of dark magic
			by a percentage
		- Spell-specific bonuses: gear that "enhances" a particular dark magic spell
	- Drain: steals enemy HP and absorbs into the caster's HP pool
		- More HP than the caster has can be absorbed, but HPP only goes to 100%
		- Potency is directly associated with the dark magic skill
			At < 300 dark magic skill, the maximum potential potency is:
				Dark Magic Skill +20
			At 300 >= dark magic skill, the maximum potential potency is:
				Dark Magic Skill x 5/8 + 132.5
		- The minimum potency is 50% of the maximum potency, and the actual potency
		  of the spell (when unresisted) will randomly fall anywhere between the
		  minimum and maximum potencial potency.
	- Aspir: steals enemy MP and absorbs into the caster's MP pool
		- More MP than the caster has can be absorbed, but MPP only goies to 100%
		- The potency is directly associated with the dark magic skill
			The maximum potency < 300 is:
				(Dark Magic Skill/3 +20) x (1 + Potency)
			The maximum potency >= 300 is:
				(Dark Magic Skill x 0.4) x (1 + Potency)
		- The minimum potency is 50% of the maximum potency and the actual potency
		  of the spell (when unresisted) will randomly fall anywhere between the
		  minimum and maximum potency.
	- Dark spells: absorb accuracy, absorb AGI, absorb CHR, absorb DEX, absorb INT,
	  absorb MND, absorb STR, absorb TP, absorb VIT, aspir, bios, drain, stun and
	  tractor

Summoning Magic
	- Summoning magic calls for an avatar to fight for the summoner, enfeeble enemies,
	  and buff the party.
	- Summoning Magic Skill reduces the chance of spell interruption and influences
	  a summoner's elemental spirits.
	- Summoning Magic Skill does many things:
		- Decreases the wait time between when an elemental spirit is summoned and
		  uses a spell and the time before casting another.
		- Increases the intelligence of the AI of an Elemental Spirit. The spirit
		  will generally cast more powerful and relevant spells more often. When the
		  AI is good, the Light Spirit sometimes defies the spell recast timer when
		  your HP is low.
		- If you're over skill cap, it affect Blood Pact: Rage and Blood Pact: Ward
			- Blood Pact: Ward - increases duration
			- Blood Pact: Rage - Accurracy bonus and Magic Accuracy bonus based on
			  how far over cap your summoning skill is.
		- Summoning skill also affects certain Blood Pact skills:
			shining ruby, glittering ruby, crimson howl, inferno howl, frost armor,
			crystal blessing, aerial armor, hastega ii, fleet wind, hastega, earthen
			ward, earthen armor, rolling thunder, lightening armor, soothing current,
			ecliptic howl, noctoshield, and dream shroud.
	- An inital MP cost is required to summon an avatar/elemental spirit into our
	  plane of existence, as well as a perpetuation cost to sustain it. The base
	  MP cost is based on the summoner's level.
	- Summoning spells: carbuncle, fenrir, ifrit, titan, leviathan, garuda, shiva,
	  ramuh, diabolos, fire spirit, ice spirit, air spirit, earth spirit, thunder
	  spirit, water spirit, light spirit, and dark spirit.

Blue Magic
	Out of era

Songs
	- Songs are a general category available only to BRD. Unlike other types of magic,
	  there are two components that together determine the skill value for the song's
	  effectiveness - singing skill and instrument skill.
	- There are two different instruments: wind and string and the type used in the
	  calculation is whichever is currentlt equipped.
	- While Magic Accuracy with songs is not clearly known, it depends on CHR and 
	  the combined skill level (sing and instrument) multiplied by a scaling factor.
	- Songs cannot be interrupted by being struck so spell interruption is not
	  necessary when playing a song.
	- There are two types of songs: party buffing and target debuffing songs.
	- With an instrument, a bard can place two active buffing songs on party members.
	- Without an instrument, a bard can only place one active buffing song on party
	  members.
	- Bard Song bonuses on equipment fall into several categories:
		- Skill bonus: directly adds to player's singing, wind, or string skill
		- Song Spellcasting Time Reduction: reduces casting time by a percentage
		- Song Recast Delay Reduction: reduces recasting cool down by a number of
		  seconds
		- Song Duration Increase: increases the duration of all songs by a percentage
		- Song-Specific bonuses: increase the potency and/or duration of a specific
		  song
	- Song duration equipment does affect offensive debuff durations
	- Base duration of a party song is 120 seconds
	- Song+ potency gear increases duration by 10% per 1 Song+
	- All gear song effect duration bonuses are additive with the duration increase
	  from song+ potency effects
	- Song types: Carols, Enfeebling, Threnodies, Recovery/Misc, Status Enhancing,
	  Status Resistence
	
Ninjutsu
	- Ninjutsu is a means of casting magic that uses ninja tools instead of MP.
	- Ninjutsu skill affects spell interruption rate, potency, and magic accuracy
	  of ninjutsu spells.
	- There are three types of ninjutsu spells: buffs, debuffs, and elemental-based
	  damage.
	- Elemental-based damage spells also lowers the resistence to the opposing
	  element.
	- Ninjutsu equipment bonuses falls into four categories:
		- Ninjutsu Magic Skill Bonus - directly adds to the player's ninjutsu skill
		- Ninjutsu Damage Enhancement - increases damage dealt by elemental ninjusu
		  spells similar to magic attack bonus.
		- Ninjutsu Recast Delay Reduction - reduces how long you have to wait before
		  recasting. Similar to haste and fast cast.
		- Ninjutsu Tool Expertise - occasionally allows the casting of a ninjutsu
		  spell without expending the associated ninja tool
	- Ninjutsu: Dotons, Dokumoris, Hojos, Hutons, Hyotons, Jubakus, Katons, Kurayamis,
	  Raitons, Suitons, Tonkos, Utsusemis
