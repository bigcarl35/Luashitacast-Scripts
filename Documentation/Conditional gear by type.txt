The following lists all of the conditional inline checks, grouped by type. Note: some conditionals
have had their names changed, for consistency purposes. Also, many inverted conditionals have been
added to represent the opposite of an existing conditional. These are all prefixed with: NOT_

The sections represent types with the inverse conditionals separated below each type. The groupings
represent "in kind" categories and in the code have their own routines for processing. This makes it
easier to add and validate new conditionals. Validation tends to focus on formatting and not logic.
You can use impossible conditionals that are perfectly formatted and the validation routine will
not detect the problem. (Validation is intended to identify syntax issues and not logic issues.)
