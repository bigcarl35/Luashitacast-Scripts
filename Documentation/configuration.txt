Welcome to configuring my Luashitacast scripts. This document should help you to tailor the
LUA so that job scripts can work the way you want them to work. There is a bit of trial and
error involved though, so don't be surprised if you have to go back into the scripts and
change some of the settings after you test that it is working the way you want. (This is not
an error, it is just the tweaking that occurs when you have configurable code.)

When you installed HorizonXi, a directory structure of the files was created that looks something
like /HorizonXI/Game/... What's confusing about this install is that there's two places that
addons can be found: /HorizonXI/Game/addons/luashitacast/ and 
/HorizonXI/Game/config/addons/luashitacast/. The former is where the luashitacast addon files 
are stored and the latter are where your configuration scripts should be placed. The scripts 
consist of three lua files, the job file (in this document I will use the BST file as an example),
gcinclude.lua and gcdisplay.lua which are found in the /common/ subdirectory. You will also find 
a text file called "Conditional gear master list.txt" in the /common/ subdirectory which contains 
a master list of all supported conditional gear. (I'll talk about that file a bit later.) The only 
two files that you will modify are the job file ("your character name"_BST.lua) and gcinclude.lua.

Each job that is supported will have a separate job file, but only one copy of gcinclude is
needed. (The job file has specific definitions for that job whereas gcinclude.lua contains 
definitions that are true across all jobs.) All configuration occurs in the top part of the
script. (You can modify the code itself if you feel comfortable doing that, but at that point
the code is yours.)

Gear sets
=========
The largest amount of configuration takes place when defining gear sets. Most of the set names
found in your job file will have the same names, it's just the gear itself that needs to be
tailored to the job. Listed below are all of the gear set names and where they're found. Where
helpful I have included a comment in the code explaining what the set is used for

Not all gear sets need to be defined, just the ones you want to. That's why you'll find some
empty definitions. Not all gear sets need all the equipment slots defined. Just specify the
gear that makes sense (if any). Don't change the names of the gear sets. If you do they won't
be used since the program is looking for the ones I've listed. Most gear sets have a conditional
gear set named similarly below their definition. These are very different from the gear set and
I'll discuss how to configure them further down in the document.

There's basically two ways to define a gear set. You either type in the definitions manually or
you take advantage of a luashitacast command and save your currently equipped gear into the 
defined gear set. The name of the gear piece has to be what it is called in the appropriate
inventory/wardrobe slot. This includes abbreviations. This is doable, but it's a bit of a pain
too. That's why I favor equipping the gear (in game) and then using the luashitacast command to
save that set into my job definitions file. (Please note that you probably need to disable
gear swapping before you can change gear manually. To do that you just type /gswap which toggles
on and off gear swapping.)

	/lac addset "gear set name"			eg.: /lac addset Charm
	
That command will replace the current definition of the specified gear set with the gear you have
equipped. Make sure you spell the gear set name correctly including capitalization. Another
advantage of using this command is there's nothing stopping you from making special gear sets that
have meaning to you. (This is what I did when I made the CAPxx sets.) If you want to use a gear set
that the program will not automatically know how to use, you use the /gearset command (eg. /gearset 
CAP40). This will equip the gear set you specified and turn off automatic gear swapping until you 
turn it back on (or append the ON parameter and gearswapping will be left on. This funtionality only
makes sense though if you're swapping weapons, an exception rather than the norm.) This is real handy 
when going into level capped zones or some other special condition you want to support.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention being able to save gear sets into the gcinclude.lua 
file with the /lac command. Unfortunately you can't do it. What I tend to do is create the set in
the job file, copy it and replace the one in gcinclude.lua. I know, it's a pain, but that does work. 
Listed below is a blank, full gear set definition. Use it as a template if you like and if you prefer
to have all the slots listed, that's fine. Just leave the piece of gear off in all slots you want
any already loaded gear to pass through. Lastly, if the gear piece's name is possessive, has an
apostrophe in the name, you need to "escape" that apostrophe. That's done with the \ before the '.
(Eg., Barbarian\'s Belt.)

	['name'] = {
        Main = ,
        Ammo = ,
        Head = ,
        Neck = ',
        Ear1 = ',
        Ear2 = ',
        Body = ',
        Hands = ',
        Ring1 = ',
        Ring2 = ',
        Back = ',
        Waist = ',
        Legs = ',
        Feet = ',
    },
	
One set you might have noticed is the Start_Weapons set. This should only contain the top row of 
the equipment you want loaded. (Specifically, the main hand, off hand, ranged, and ammo slot.)
One of the big problems that occur when you swap weapons is the loss of TP. To minimize this loss
it is recommended that weapons are only specified in this set and you leave the top row of your
equipment empty when you save other gear sets. The program does support weapon swapping, but only
if you indicate that weapon swapping is permitted. (Use /WSwap to turn on/off this feature.) The
program only swaps to elemental staves where appropriate. "Start_Weapons" are loaded when you change
to the job or when you login.
	
Conditional Gear
================
There is gear that has conditional properties, ones that will only be enabled when the specified
condition is met (eg., +3 evasion in areas controlled by home nation). You don't want that type
of gear to be loaded all the time unless the rest of the stats make it worthwhile, but if the
condition can be met, that piece of gear might be worth using. That's what the conditional gear
areas are used for. There's a file in the /common/ area called "Conditional gear master list.txt"
that contains a list of all of the gear in FFXI that has conditional settings supported by the
luashitacast scripts. Below each gear set definition you will probably find a "conditional" block.
This is where you specify the gear you want loaded if the appropriate condition is met. You do this
by copying the line of the gear piece you want from the "master" list and pasting it into the 
appropriate "conditional" block. If you want to specify more than one conditional, the entries
must be separated by a comma. Some conditionals are not found on the gear description, but are
custom and have been implemented in the code. These are also found in the "master" list. Each
definition line in the "master" list contains: an item code, name of the gear piece, and a 
description. The first two parts should not be modified, but the description can be anything you
want. It's intended to tell you what condition needs to be met.

Example of a conditional block:

	['TP_Conditional'] = {
		{'BD-1','Gaudy Harness','Adds refresh if MP < 50'},
		{'RN-11','Tamas Ring','will equip if subjob can do magic'}
	},

If no conditional gear are specified, the block will look like:

	['TP_Conditional'] = {
	},
	
Please note that the same conditional gear can be specified in many "conditional" blocks.

Gear Set Relationship
=====================
One of the things that won't be obvious when looking at the gear sets is how they interact with
each other. Successive gear swaps will overwrite where gear is specified and leave gear that was
previously equipped where no gear was specified in the new set. This "layering" effect ends up
giving you an amalgamation set representing all the pieces that were overlapped. In most cases
only one set is used at a time (with the associated "conditional" gear possibly taking precidence.)
But, in some cases many sets are considered. The most complex is probably when casting magic.

There is a Precast and a Midcast section and each address different concerns, but both are done
for each spell. The Precast focuses on equipping gear that have fast cast and casting time reduction
gear while Midcast focuses on magic attack, magic attack bonus, and magic enhancing gear. Spell
cast is further broken down by type (eg., curing or enfeebling), stat enhancing, magical accuracy,
and sometimes specific spell enhancements. The processing looks like this:

Precast
	Precast gear
	Precast conditional gear
	Elemental Obi for magical accuracy
	
Midcast
	Midcast gear
	Midcast conditional gear
	Mind or Intelligence gear, accordingly
	Mind or Intelligence conditional gear, accordingly
	Specific spell gear, accordingly
	Specific spell conditional gear, accordingly
	Magical accuracy gear, if specified
	Magical accuracy conditional gear, if specified
	Spell type gear
	Spell type conditional gear
	Elemental Obi for magical damage
	Possible swapping of weapon to a stave to enhance the spell's effect
	
That's quite a process and definitely the most comprehensive.

Other Settings
==============
The only other thing in the BST job file that might be modified is the profile.JugPets table. This
contains a list of all of the BST jug pets supported on HorizonXI including details on what is the 
jug called, what pet is summoned, the min/max level the pet is useful for, how long it lasts, do
you have access to that jug (programmatically determined) and the field you might want to change,
if the jug pet favored. By that I mean if given a list of jugs you can equip that are level appropriate,
are their any you prefer to equip. This data is used when you invoke "call beast" and you don't have 
a jug pet broth equipped in your ammo slot. Ideally only one jug pet is favored in a specific level 
range, but if you specify multiple, it means that any one of those are fine and the first one the 
program finds will be used. To specify you favor a jug pet, change the last "false" on the line to 
"true". If you don't want this "automated" jug selection, you can turn the feature off by typing
/AJug.

In the gcinclude.lua file, there's more customization needed. Past the gear sets the first thing you
run into are the gcinclude.settings. Most of them are automatically set by the program or by you through the
appropriate command, but RegenGearHPP and RefreshGearMPP can only be modified by you. They represent
the percentage value for HP and MP, respectively, when the appropriate gear will be equipped during
Idle and Rest. The defaults are 60% HP and 70% MP. Please note that the MP refresh setting may have no
meaning if the main job/sub job does not employ magic.

That's pretty much it. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
