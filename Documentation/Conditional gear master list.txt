I think it's important to understand conditionals in regards to this implementation of
Luashitacast before getting to the "nit-gritty" details. Conditionals started out as a
way to support gear that had a conditional aspect to them like "... if your nation controls
the area your in". Initially I created a master list for all gear that has that type of
wording, but soon I discovered that there were conditionals that were Player defined. Things
like "if it's nighttime" even though that phrase was not to be found on the item's description.
Basically the player was coming up with circumstances that they wanted an item equipped that
had nothing to do with gear descriptions. Shortly thereafter came the concept of inline
conditionals and I had to rethink the concept all together.

For awhile there were two types of conditions supported: "Block" and "Inline", but block
has since been removed. Only "Inline" conditionals are now supported. An "Inline"
conditional asks a question that can be answered with Yes or No. Is it night time? Is your
subjob a ninja? Is anyone in your party a bard? etc. There's a master list of conditional
types found below. You designate an "Inline" conditional by appending a "//" and the code
to the piece of gear in your gear set.

How about an example? This is from a BST job file:

['Start_Weapons'] = {
	Main = { 'Maneater', 'Barbaroi Axe', 'Ryl.Arc. Sword' },	-- Sword added for low level option
    Sub  = { 'Tabarzin//SJNIN', 'War Pick//SJNIN', 'Tatami Shield' },
    Ammo = 'S. Herbal Broth',
},

In this case the Tabarzin would be loaded in your sub gear slot if your main job is high 
enough level and your subjob is Ninja. If the Tabarzin is too high a level, the War Pick's
level will be checked.

The other thing to note is that you can have multiple inline conditionals on one piece of
gear (eg. Feet = 'Monsoon Kyahan//EVASION//WTH:EARTH'. Item would be quipped if the evasion
flag is true and there's earth weather (i.e., sandstorm.) If you want to "or" the multiple
inline conditions, enter it multiple times on separate gear (eg. 

	Feet = {'Monsoon Kyahan//EVASION', 'Monsoon Kyahan//WTH:EARTH'}

Of course, the above example isn't the correct check for the piece of gear, you want
the double conditional shown above it.

Here's a list of all the "Inline" conditionals currently supported. Let me know if you 
want me to add any more.
