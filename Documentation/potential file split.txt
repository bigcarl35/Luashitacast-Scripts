Some notes on reorganizing my luashitacast

The Job files will be split into two files:
    1) User_JOB.lua (or) Job.lua
    2) Support.lua

    The first file (whether specific to a job or user/job combo) will consist of the "profile" gear sets, job definitions, and the init configuration function. The macro bar/menu selection will
    be changed to be assigned via variables. Further, references to all the included files will go here. (To lua all the separate files will look like a single big file.)

    The second file will contain all of the rest of the code for a job. Unlike the first file, this one should not be modified. (I might have to change how variables are referenced in the code though, I need to test this out to see if needed.)

gcinclude will be split into n files:
    1) gcinclude.lua
    2) utilities.lua
    2) midcast.lua
    3) inline.lua
    4) gear.lua
    5) elemental.lua

    The first file will contain the cross job gear sets, any definitions, and any system level functions

    The second file contains the common support routines like locking, target id, etc

    The third file contains all of the midcast functions

    The fourth file contains all the functions for validating inline functions

    The fifth file contains all functions dealing with gear including the /SMG functions

    The sixth file contains all functions dealing with elemental gear like staves, obis, and gorgets
