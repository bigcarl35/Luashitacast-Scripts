- Added *:San ninjutsu to gcinclude.TMtest, currently commented out since it's from
  merits category 2

- Renamed DefaultTarget to DefaultSpellTarget and named default target for song to 
  DefaultSongTarget
  
- Changed HandleMidcast to check for bard song affinities; ninjutsu does not use
  elemental affinities, so using elemental staves makes no difference. Magical
  Affinity affects the magic accuracy on some bard spells, it does not affect
  duration nor potency. This means you don't need to worry about the day's element
  nor the weather. (Just turn WSWAP off if you don't want the staff equipped.)
  
- Changed HandleMidcast so that it does not equip an elemental staff when summoning
  an avatar/spirit. HandleDefault in the job file still equips the appropriate elemental
  staff when you have an avatar/spirit pet out.
  
- Fixed a bug in gcinclude.fCheckForElementalGearByValue, re: obi/gorget slot
  association.

- Switched over to using gcinclude.fCheckForElementalGearByValue to determine if the
  weaponskill is elemental in nature and whether the player has the appropriate
  gorget in HandleWeaponskill.
