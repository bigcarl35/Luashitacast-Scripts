HP comparison to maxHP:

- Invisible gear's added/subtracted HP should be excluded from the maxHP
  (ears,rings,neck,waist,back).
- Gear with % increases need to be calculated as follows:
	- Base HP is maxHP - gear bonus HP - trait boosted HP; merits count.
	- This value is multiplied by the % increase. That gives you how much added/subtracted.
- Gear with conversion, MP to HP
- To determine the value to compare:
	maxHP - % increase from equipped gear - flat HP bonuses from gear - trait HP=base
	Calculation of ratio is then current HP/base HP. (Note that this could be above
	100%.)
- Gear w/range for HP/MP, like with a Tamas ring. (Value based on your level)
	
Order of process:
	- Remove flat bonuses
	- Remove conversions (i.e., convert 25 MP to HP)
	- Remove % boost (how to determine what the base is?)
		(base x % boost) + base = current base
		x * .01 + x = 909			900 * .01 + 900 = 909
		
		x = 909/1.01 or 900
		
Structure:
	- Current maxHP
	- Flat HP
	- Conversion HP
	- % Boost HP
	- Base maxHP
