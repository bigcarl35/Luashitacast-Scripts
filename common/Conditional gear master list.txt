I think it's important to understand conditionals in regards to this implementation of
Luashitacast before getting to the "nit-gritty" details. Conditionals started out as a
way to support gear that had a conditional aspect to them like "... if your nation controls
the area your in". Initially I created a master list for all gear that has that type of
wording, but soon I discovered that there were conditionals that were Player defined. Things
like "if it's nighttime" even though that phrase was not to be found on the item's description.
Basically the player was coming up with circumstances that they wanted an item equipped that
had nothing to do with gear descriptions. Shortly thereafter came the concept of inline
conditionals and I had to rethink the concept all together.

This implementation supports two types of conditionals: "Block" and "Inline". What you put
where depends on what you want. A block conditional is an overriding definition. If the
conditional aspect is found to be true, that piece of gear is loaded regardless of what
was specified in the associated gear set. You use a block conditional when you want an
item equipped regardless of any other considerations. ^Caveat: block conditionals are
currently also used when multiple conditions must be met. Inline currently doesn't support
multiple conditions. WIP^

An inline conditional puts a question on a specific piece in the priority order of gear
for a specific slot. Unlike the block conditional which is in it's own separate set block,
inline is attached to the gear's name via a "//" (e.g., //SJNIN, which checks to see if
the player's subjob in ninja.)

How about an example? The following shows the same thing, but uses an inline versus a 
block conditional, but one is actually more versatile than the other. This is from a 
BST job file:

['Start_Weapons'] = {
	Main = { 'Maneater', 'Barbaroi Axe', 'Ryl.Arc. Sword' },	-- Sword added for low level option
    Sub  = { 'Tabarzin//SJNIN', 'War Pick//SJNIN', 'Tatami Shield' },
    Ammo = 'S. Herbal Broth',
},
['Start_Weapons_Conditional'] = {
},

or 

['Start_Weapons'] = {
    Main = { 'Maneater', 'Barbaroi Axe', 'Ryl.Arc. Sword' },	-- Sword added for low level option
    Sub  = 'Tatami Shield',
    Ammo = 'S. Herbal Broth',
},
['Start_Weapons_Conditional'] = {
	{'War Pick','Equip if /nin or /dnc','Sub',31,'WAR/DRK/BST/RUN','SJIS','NIN/DNC'},
	{'Tabarzin','Equip if /nin or /dnc','Sub',71,'WAR/DRK/BST/RUN','SJIS','NIN/DNC'},
},

in both cases you're equipping an axe in the offhand slot if the player's subjob is either
/nin or /dnc. The first example says that the offhand will be an axe (which depends on your
main job's level) if you're /nin or /dnc. Otherwise a tatami shield will be equipped (unless
your level is too low.) The second example says that the tatami shield will be equipped
unless one of the block conditionals are found to be true. Note that you want the higher 
level entried to be below the lower level entries. It will equip the last entry where the
condition is met.

Now, this example has the same behavior either way, but in some cases you'll want to avoid
using the overriding block conditional. (Say you want the tatami shield equipped if you can't
equip the tabarzin axe. Just flip flop the "war pick" and the "tatami shield" entries in
the inline example. The block example cannot do that specific behavior without omitting
the "war pick" entry.)

Conditional block entries consist of the following fields:
gear name,description,slot name,minimum level,"/" delimited list of jobs that can equip
said item or ALL,conditional code word,value(s) to match,... potentially other fields if
multi-conditional. I've listed most of the conditional gear entries that mention conditions
in their descriptions as well as some of the pler defined conditionals I have used. Just
copy and paste the ones you want to use into your gear sets.
