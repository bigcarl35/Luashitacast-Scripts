--[[
	The gear sets are self contained, a mixture of direct gear assignments and conditional
	assignments. Each set contains entries identified by the gear slot. If it's a single
	value, it's a direct assignment like: Body = 'Austere Robe', but there can be multiple
	items identified, usually ordered by level: Body = { 'Vermillion Cloak//CARBY','Austere Robe' },
	Any item that has a // appended to it contains an inline conditional. The // code is a test
	to see if the item should be equipped. The level is still checked, but if the inline coded
	test is successful, that piece of gear will be loaded. Currently nothing checks to see
	if that item can be equipped by the job it's associated with let alone whether the player
	even has it accessible. Those are all planned for the future. In the mean time the onus is
	on the player to create the correct definitions.
	
	Not all sets need to be defined. There is nothing wrong with leaving a set "empty", but don't
	delete any of the sets. All the ones listed here (except for any custom sets) are expected to 
	exist by Luashitacast.
		
	*** Note ***
	/SMN has a problem in that their pet is the level of the subjob, which is not very useful. 
	As a result, /SMN pet actions are treated "as is" without gearset swap support.	As for /DRG,
	please note that the wyvern can't be summoned.

	Also, unlike true pet jobs like SMN and BST, PLD can only have a pet through a subjob. While 
	associated pet gearsets are available, you equally can just skip them since the pet is at 
	half your level.
	
	*** Note 2 ***
	No gear that supports bard songs can be worn by any job except a bard, so there's no explicit
	support given here for /BRD.
	
	Horizon changes from retail:
		- Minor changes to artifact armor and significant changes to Casting Wand
		- Major changes to Claustum
		- +2 to base MP recovery rate for a total of +6, gained upon attaining 75
		- Some elemental spell scrolls have been reduced at the vendor
		- Magic Bursts receive an extra +35 magic accuracy, +35 magic attack and
		  reduced enmity generations except on notorious monsters
		- Poison's DOT effect increased from 1 to 4/tick
