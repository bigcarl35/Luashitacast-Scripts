# Luashitacast-Scripts
This repository contains my Luashitacast scripts that I have tailored to work on the FFXI private server HorizonXI

	This implementation of a Luashitacast script is based on the code that GetAwayCoxn has published in
	GitHub. I have done a fair amount of rewriting as well as dropping features that are appropriate to the
	current expansion found on HorizonXI private server. I have also added new code to support functuality
	that my friends and I wanted. You can use this code "as is" or change as you desire for your own needs.
